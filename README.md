# Steering-Angle-Correction-Using-Deep-Learning-for-Autonomous-Driving

# Introduction:
This repository contains code for a behavioral cloning project using a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented in Keras. The project involves training a model to drive a car autonomously in a simulated environment.

# Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - keras
  - scikit-learn
  - imgaug
  - opencv-python
  - pandas
  - socketio
  - eventlet
  - flask

You can install these libraries using pip:
  -  pip install numpy matplotlib keras scikit-learn imgaug opencv-python pandas socketio eventlet flask

# Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is stored in the 'Data' directory. It contains a CSV file named 'driving_log.csv' and a directory named 'IMG' with the corresponding images. The CSV file contains the following columns: 'center', 'left', 'right', 'steering', 'throttle', 'reverse', 'speed'.

# Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing steps are performed before training the model. The following steps are implemented:
  1. Extract the filename from the file path for 'center', 'left', and 'right' images.
  2. Visualize the distribution of steering angles and remove samples to balance the data.
  3. Apply image augmentation techniques such as zoom, pan, random brightness, and flipping to generate additional training data.
  4. Preprocess the images by cropping, converting to YUV color space, applying Gaussian blur, and resizing.

# Model Architecture
The model architecture used is based on the NVIDIA End-to-End Deep Learning model. It consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers. The model is defined in the nvidia_model function.

# Training
The model is trained using the fit_generator function, which generates batches of training data and performs training for a specified number of epochs. The training data is generated by the batch_generator function, which applies image augmentation and preprocessing techniques.

# Testing and Autonomous Driving
To test the model and observe its performance in autonomous driving, a server is set up using Flask and SocketIO. The model is loaded, and telemetry data containing the car's speed and camera image is received from the simulator. The image is preprocessed, fed into the model, and the predicted steering angle is sent back to the simulator for controlling the car.

# Running the Code
Make sure you have the required libraries installed.
Place the dataset (CSV file and image directory) in the 'Data' directory.
Run the code to train the model.
Start the simulator and choose the autonomous driving mode.
Run the code for testing and autonomous driving.
Note: The code assumes that the model file is saved as 'model.h5' in the current directory. If you have saved the model with a different name or path, make sure to update the code accordingly.

Enjoy autonomous driving with the trained model!
